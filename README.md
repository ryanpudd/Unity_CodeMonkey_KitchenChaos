Plan

Setup a build
Create 10 levels with a set delivery
Additional complexities
 - Plates returned and need washing
 - Deep fat fryer
 - Multiple plates (like a meal)

Notes

Refactor StateMachine to be generic

Gamemode where recipes have timers and when you miss more than 3 you end

Make a few different levels
Migrate to a ServiceRegistry model
Find a model that removes the need for static events (remove the need for ResetStaticDataManager)
Saving player progress
Add unit tests
Refactor Sound/Music
Change to props
Refactor options screen to use the layout manager?
Make OptionsUI a prefab and add it to the MainMenu
Change so you can pick up a plate and put your ingredient on it

In general - Polish
 - Audio
 - Particles?
